    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" target="_blank" title="Aspirin wikipedia">Aspirin</a> is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk.For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. <br>Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.
    <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong>One common adverse effect is an <u>upset stomach</strong>.</u>
    More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma.[9] <br>Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners.[9] <br>Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy.[9] It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome.[9] High doses may result in ringing in the ears.
